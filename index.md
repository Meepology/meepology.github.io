Welcome to meepleogy! It is the study of tabletop games and their strategies by applying
mathematics, economics, and computer science.

I graduated college with a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Economics. Shortly after graduating,
I got in to tabletop games as a [community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cebuboardgamers/) was brewing in my hometown.
Being competitive, I would sometimes try to mathematically devise strategy and imagine game simulations I could run
to reveal some yet unknown paths to victory.

This website is a project that I've wanted to start for a while now but I get too busy actually playing the games
instead of thinking more about them. Now, I want to take a step back and start being more of a _theoretical_ gamer (haha).
There's this funny quote: "That is all very well in practice, but how will it work out in theory?"

Previous works that inspired me to pursue this include:

* [A Knowledge-based Approach of Connect-Four](http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~fernau/DSL0607/Masterthesis-Viergewinnt.pdf)
* [Analysis of Chutes and Ladders](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/november12011/)
* And all the chess books I had read during my chess days

I hope you'll have as much fun reading these elaborate analyses as I have writing them.
Hopefully, this will actually help us becoming smarter tabletop gamers.
